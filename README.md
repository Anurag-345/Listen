# Purpose of Project

The main aim of developing this Online Music Portal System , 
it’s a collection of MP3 songs of different languages in one place where users can stream the songs based on their taste. 
The project will also be mobile responsive, so if the website 
would ever be deployed, it will be available on mobile devices.

The problem's i identified are : 

1. Expensive : <br/>
If you switch to the paid plan of any music streaming platform you’ll have to
pay every month irrespective of whether or
not you’re using the service. At $120 per
year for the Premium service, that’s about
10 to 12 albums that you could buy from a
vendor and actually own, rather than
pushing money into Spotify’s service, from
which you basically just rent your music
unless you decide to buy tracks from the
firm.

2. Sound Quality :<br/>
Weak quality of sound for free users. If you’re a Spotify Free user, you need to note that when
listening, the sound quality is poor and the rate is 160kbps, whereas the Premium users enjoy
320kbps of music streaming.


3. Ads :<br/>
Spotify users have to listen to audio advertisements between their favourite songs and podcast
shows if they use the free account. Plus, you can’t stream individual songs on demand, and you

can skip just 6 tracks every hour. This is an extremely bad experience for users, especially when
you hear things you don’t like.

4. Limitations :<br/>
By using a free account mobile app, you can listen to any songs in any order with unlimited track
skips as long as they appear on one of the 15 personalized playlists selected by Spotify’s
machine learning algorithms for you.
You can stream a whole playlist or only 3,333 songs for offline use after you’ve upgraded to the
Premium services, but there’s no way to download one single song. When your subscription
expires, you won’t have access to any of the content you downloaded offline.
